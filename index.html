    <h1>Hi There!</h1>
    <p>I'm a dedicated and versatile software engineer with a passion for technology and innovation. My journey is a testament to a continuous quest for knowledge and the fusion of diverse fields to drive forward-thinking solutions. With six years of professional experience, primarily in <strong>iOS software development</strong>, I'm currently enriching my expertise of information sciences by pursuing a master's degree in <strong>Data Science</strong> at the <strong>University of Amsterdam</strong>.</p>
    <h2>A Unique Academic Foundation:</h2>
    <p>My academic journey began with a bachelor's degree in <strong>Molecular Bionic Engineering</strong>, a field where biology meets advanced technology, focusing on understanding the complexities of biological systems and employing this knowledge to solve engineering challenges. My thesis, "<strong>Preprocessing medical images with deep learning for deep learning</strong>," allowed me to delve deep into the intersection of computer science and biology, exploring how advanced algorithms can significantly enhance medical diagnostics and treatments. This experience laid a solid foundation in programming and computational thinking, while also broadening my perspective on the potential of technology to make meaningful contributions to healthcare and beyond.</p>
    <p>Transitioning from the nuanced realm of molecular bionics to the dynamic world of iOS application development, and now to data science, my career trajectory might seem unconventional.
